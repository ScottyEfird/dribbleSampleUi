# Coding Challange 

Things I'd add if I had more time:
- Jest for unit tests ðŸŽ‰
- Style Component Library ðŸ’…
- Mobile Components (Ie, return custom components on smaller screen sizes)
- General CSS clean up ðŸ’ª
- A cool webserver to GET from

The guidelines asked for a server with query support (for filtering), full CRUD endpoints and that the design is followed exactly. Unfortunately, working full time I lack the time to do all that you've asked. Instead I've hacked out an awesome basic template of your UI. I'd take a look at my other repos for more examples of work I've done. 

This is a cool little 24/hr hacker challange I did that shows a React/Redux app
